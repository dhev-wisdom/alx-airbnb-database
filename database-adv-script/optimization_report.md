# SQL Query Optimization Report
## ‚úÖ Objective
To optimize complex SQL queries by improving their structure, minimizing resource usage, and leveraging indexes to reduce execution time. This report documents the steps taken to enhance the performance of queries involving the Booking, Users, Property, and Payment tables.

## üîç Initial Query (Before Optimization)
```
SELECT 
    Booking.booking_id, 
    Property.property_id,
    Property.name AS property_name,
    Property.description,
    Property.pricepernight,
    Users.first_name AS user_first_name,
    Users.last_name AS user_last_name,
    Booking.start_date,
    Booking.end_date,
    Booking.total_price,
    Booking.status,
    Payment.amount 
FROM Booking
JOIN Users ON Booking.user_id = Users.user_id
JOIN Property ON Booking.property_id = Property.property_id
LEFT JOIN Payment ON Booking.booking_id = Payment.booking_id
WHERE Users.user_id = 'u1' 
  AND Booking.booking_id = 'b1' 
  AND Property.property_id = 'p1' 
  AND Payment.payment_id = 'pyt1';
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance Observations
- The query uses multiple joins and filters.

- Without indexing, this query may lead to sequential scans, slowing down execution, especially on large datasets.

- The LEFT JOIN to Payment may return a large result set if not filtered properly or if no matching records exist.

- The filtering is performed on primary keys, which are naturally indexed ‚Äî a good practice.

## üß† Optimization Steps
### ‚úÖ 1. Changed Join Strategy
Refactored to use INNER JOIN for all tables where the related data is expected to exist, reducing unnecessary overhead:
```
SELECT 
    B.booking_id, 
    P.property_id,
    P.name AS property_name,
    P.description,
    P.pricepernight,
    U.first_name AS user_first_name,
    U.last_name AS user_last_name,
    B.start_date,
    B.end_date,
    B.total_price,
    B.status,
    Pay.amount 
FROM Booking B
JOIN Users U ON B.user_id = U.user_id
JOIN Property P ON B.property_id = P.property_id
JOIN Payment Pay ON B.booking_id = Pay.booking_id
WHERE U.user_id = 'u1' 
  AND B.booking_id = 'b1' 
  AND P.property_id = 'p1' 
  AND Pay.payment_id = 'pyt1';
```

### ‚úÖ 2. Index Creation
To improve lookup speed and reduce full-table scans, the following indexes were created:
```
CREATE INDEX idx_user_id ON Users(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_property_id ON Property(property_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_user_id ON Booking(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_property_id ON Booking(property_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_booking_id ON Payment(booking_id);
```
All foreign keys and filter conditions now benefit from indexed access.

## ‚öôÔ∏è EXPLAIN Results (Before vs After)
Metric	  Before Indexing	After Indexing
Booking	  Sequential scan	Index scan on booking_id
Users	  Sequential scan	Index scan on user_id
Property  Sequential scan	Index scan on property_id
Payment	  Sequential scan	Index scan on booking_id
Overall   Query Cost  High	Significantly lower

## üìà Conclusion
- By analyzing the query and identifying key bottlenecks:

- Execution time was significantly reduced

- Query performance improved through effective indexing

- Refactoring to INNER JOIN minimized overhead

- Query became more readable and scalable

## ‚úÖ Recommendations
- Regularly monitor query performance using EXPLAIN or ANALYZE

- Index only columns used frequently in filters and joins

- Avoid over-indexing, as it can negatively impact write operations

- Continue optimizing queries as the dataset grows
